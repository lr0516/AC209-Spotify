    "\"Recognizing musical mood remains a challenging problem primarily due to the inherent ambiguities of human emotions.\" In this paper, we learn that recognizing musical mood is a multiclass-multilabel classification or regression problem, where we try to annotate each music piece with a set of emotions. We can represent moods as multi-dimensional vector. In addition, we can directly use the existing music database, which has been manually annotated, to train our model."

Each profile can be viewed as a vector, whose entries are paired with a set of features. We also need to create vectors with the same components that describe the user’s preferences. Then we can just calculate the cosine distance between two sets to measure the similarity of two playlists."
