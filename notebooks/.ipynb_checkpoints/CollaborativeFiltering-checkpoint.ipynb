    "It is intuitive that people who listen to the same songs have similar tastes in music, and this is the basic assumption of collaborative filtering. Interactions between a bunch of users and a bunch of items can be represented by a utility matrix with a lot of blanks (since some of the interactions are absent). Collaborative filtering techniques fill in the blanks of the utility matrix by giving predictions based on existing interactions. We build up the collaborative filtering models based on Million Playlist Dataset, assuming that users with similar past behaviors are likely to listen to the same songs in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build up the collborative filtering models, we use matrix factorization technique. The idea behind matrix factorization technique is that users actually respond to some very specific features of items and these features could be captured by decomposing the $n*m$ utility matrix into two matrices whose dimensions are $$n*d$$ and $$d*m$$. (Here d is the number of features characterized by the specific decomposition.) When people listen to music, they may be attracted by some very specific characteristics such as artist, genre and emotions passed by the music. So matrix factorization technique is suitable for music recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [Spotlight library](https://maciejkula.github.io/spotlight/index.html) which is based on PyTorch to build up matrix factorization models to get prediction utility matrix for all the users on all the items included in the training data set. We use the implicit feedback models as users do not give explicit ratings for the songs in the playlists. Only presence and absence of events can be captured from the Million Playlist Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that utility matrix is determined, for each user in the test dataset, we predict his/her ratings on the tracks by calculating the weighted sum of training dataset usersâ€™ ratings on the tracks. The weight of users in the training dataset is defined by cosine similarity between users in the training dataset and the specific tested user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three collaborative filtering models which are:\n",
    "    - Baseline Model\n",
    "    - Filtered-Data Model\n",
    "    - Meta-Playlist Model\n",
    " These three models differ the most in their training datasets."
