We consider this set of values to be one observation. Moreover, we can assign the output of this observation to be one if this song track actually exists in the true validation output corresponding to this particular input, and we assign zero otherwise. Since the stacking problem outputs only take up values one or zero, we use Logistic Regression to achieve stacking. In order not to overfit to this validation set, we apply Cross Validation when we train our Logistic Regression model.\n",

To combat this issue, when we train our Logistic Regression CV model, we keep all the observations whose output is 1, and randomly sample observations whose output is 0, so that the resulting stacking model is balanced."
